    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <!-- href = hypertext reference
    target = specifies where link will open. Default is _self
    rel = attribute, relation between current page and linked Document

    SECURITY REASONS - always pair _black with noopener & noreferrer
    noopener = prevents opened link from gaining access to page it was opened on. Prevents phishing attacks
    noreferrer = prevents opened link from knowing which webpage has a link/reference to it -->

    <!-- ./ specifies to code that it should look for file/directory relative to current directoty -->
